Mini-XML v4.0 adds some new features, updates the callback APIs to include data
pointers, and generally cleans up and normalizes the interfaces from prior
releases.  While largely similar, this release is not source or binary
compatible with Mini-XML v3.x - migration details are included in the
documentation.

Mini-XML v4.0 weighs in at a mere 3,491 lines of code, down from the 4,300 lines
of code in Mini-XML v4.0.0.  Changes include:

- Now require C99 support (Issue #300)
- Now install as "libmxml4" to support installing both Mini-XML 3.x and 4.x at
  the same time (use `--disable-libmxml4-prefix` configure option to disable)
- Added `mxmlLoadIO` and `mxmlSaveIO` functions to load and save XML via
  callbacks (Issue #98)
- Added new `MXML_TYPE_CDATA`, `MXML_TYPE_COMMENT`, `MXML_TYPE_DECLARATION`, and
  `MXML_TYPE_DIRECTIVE` node types (Issue #250)
- Added `mxmlLoadFilename` and `mxmlSaveFilename` functions (Issue #291)
- Added AFL fuzzing support (Issue #306)
- Added `mxmlOptions` APIs to replace the long list of callbacks and options for
  each of the load and save functions (Issue #312)
- Added string copy/free callbacks to support alternate memory management of
  strings.
- Renamed `mxml_type_t` enumerations to `MXML_TYPE_xxx` (Issue #251)
- Updated APIs to use bool type instead of an int representing a boolean value.
- Updated the SAX callback to return a `bool` value to control processing
  (Issue #51)
- Updated the load and save callbacks to include a context pointer (Issue #106)
- Fixed some warnings (Issue #301)
- Fixed real number support in non-English locales (Issue #311)

Enjoy!
