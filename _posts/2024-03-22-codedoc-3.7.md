bugs. Changes include:

  macro instead of ".IN" in man output (Issue #12)
- Added support for `@body@` comment directive to add body text inline with code
  (Issue #10)
- Added highlighting of HTML and XML in code-fenced markdown (Issue #19)
- Added highlighting of CSS in code-fenced markdown.
- Added highlighting of reserved words, numbers, and strings in reference
  documentation, to match markdown code example highlighting.

- Fixed support for markdown code fences and indentation in code example
  comments.
