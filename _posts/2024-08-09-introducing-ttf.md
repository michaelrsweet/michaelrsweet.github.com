TTF is a simple C library for using TrueType and OpenType font files.  I've
actually been embedding this in a couple other projects but wanted to make
the core project more visible for those that need to work with font files.

I'm providing TTF under the Apache License Version 2.0 with an (optional)
exception to allow linking against GPL2/LGPL2 software.
