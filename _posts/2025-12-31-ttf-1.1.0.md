- Added `ttfCreateData` function to create a font from a memory buffer.
- Added `ttfContainsChar` and `ttfContainsChars` functions to determine whether a font contains the necessary characters (Issue #2)
- Added `ttfGetKernedExtents` function to get kerned extents (Issue #6)
- Added guards against fonts claiming they have 0 characters.
- Added stddef.h include to ttf.h.
- Added support for more kinds of TrueType/OpenType fonts.
- Fixed range checking in `ttfGetExtents` (Issue #9)
