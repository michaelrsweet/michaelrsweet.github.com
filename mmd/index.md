`mmd` is a miniature markdown parsing "library" consisting of a single C source
file and accompanying header file.  `mmd` mostly conforms to the [CommonMark][]
version of markdown syntax with the following exceptions:

- Embedded HTML markup and entities are explicitly not supported or allowed;
  the reason for this is to better support different kinds of output from the
  markdown "source", including XHTML, man, and `xml2rfc`.

- Tabs are silently expanded to the markdown standard of four spaces since HTML
  uses eight spaces per tab.

- Some pathological nested link and inline style features supported by
  CommonMark (`******Really Strong Text******`) are not supported by `mmd`.

In addition, `mmd` supports a couple (otherwise undocumented) markdown
extensions:

- Metadata as used by Jekyll and other web markdown solutions.

- "@" links which resolve to headings within the file.

- Tables and task lists as used by the [Github Flavored Markdown Spec][GFM].
