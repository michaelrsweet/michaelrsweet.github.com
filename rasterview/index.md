RasterView is a CUPS, PWG, and Apple raster file viewer.  It basically allows
you to look at the raster data produced by any of the standard CUPS RIP filters
(`cgpdftoraster`, `imagetoraster`, `pdftoraster`, and `pstoraster`) or the
`ipptransform` tool and is normally used to either test those filters or look
at the data that is being sent to your raster printer driver or printer.
