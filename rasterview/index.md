RasterView is a CUPS, PWG, and Apple raster file viewer.  It basically allows you to look at the raster data produced by any of the standard CUPS RIP filters (`cgpdftoraster`, `imagetoraster`, `pdftoraster`, and `pstoraster`) or the `ipptransform` tool and is normally used to either test those filters or look at the data that is being sent to your raster printer driver or printer.

Binaries are provided by me for Linux® on the snapcraft store and macOS® (10.14+) and Windows (10+) on the Github download page.
