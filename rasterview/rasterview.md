Introduction
============

RasterView is an Apple, CUPS, and PWG raster file viewer.  It basically allows
you to look at the raster data produced by any of the standard CUPS RIP filters
(`cgpdftoraster`, `imagetoraster`, `pdftoraster`, and `pstoraster`) or the
`ipptransform` tool and is normally used to either test those filters or look
at the data that is being sent to your raster printer driver or printer.

RasterView is licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0.


Running RasterView
==================

The program is called "rasterview" on UNIX/Linux and "RasterView.app" on macOS.
Run the program and then open a raster file, or pass the filename on the
command-line.  You can view multiple files simultaneously.
